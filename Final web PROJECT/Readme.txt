# Clinic Queue Manager Web Project

## Overview

Clinic Queue Manager is a digital solution designed to streamline patient flow in clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. The system allows patients to register for a queue number, staff to manage the list via a dashboard, and patients to receive notifications when their turn is near. This reduces overcrowding, improves patient experience, and makes healthcare visits more efficient.
